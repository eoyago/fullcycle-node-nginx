# Aplication in node - Full Cycle

This is a node application where you make a reverse proxy using nginx.

## Getting Started
To run for the first time, run the following command:
```
docker compose up -d --build
```
> In the next executions the flag "--build" is no longer necessary, because the images will already be generated.


## Expected Result
As a result, you must see the message "Full Cycle Rocks!!"  and some names on your internet browser.
